# My-Vegan-Meal-Prep-System
I plan to make a system to recommend several recipes and make a grocery list for the recipes I choose. The system should be able to take feedback on the recipes I did or did not pick and update itself accordingly and return a grocery list of all my chosen recipes for the week. 

## Welcome!
Hi! I am Alexandria and welcome to the overview of my project! I would like to share the journey I am going on to solve my meal prepping problem. I hope it inspires you to find ways to automate some tasks so your time can be spent doing the things you love.

## Background
I LOVE cooking, more particularly I love making vegan recipes. I currently have 17 vegan cookbooks and 8 vegan food blogs I follows. When doing my weekly prep, I go through several of these sources to get inspiration for what I want to make. This is time consuming! There are times were this is enjoyable but when done EVERY week it can be overwhelming, as I am also a full time mom of two little ones, part time graduate student, and currently looking for a job. I want to steamline this process by having a system give me a few suggestions. I also want this system to make my grocery list since this is my least favorite task in meal prepping. 

## Process

### Problem

How can I reduse the time it takes me to meal prep while still using the resources I already have?

#### Objective
I plan to make a system to recommend several recipes and make a grocery list for the recipes I choose. The system
should be able to take feedback on the recipes I did or did not pick and update itself accordingly and return a grocery
list of all my chosen recipes for the week. 
        
#### Measures
How much does my meal prep time reduce? What is it currently? Do I stick with the meal prep more often? Currently I
don't always commit to my meal prep if I don't make my grocery list first.
              

### Collecting The Data 

I will include a more detailed notebook that I hope to link here! I have 17 cookbooks and 8 vegan blogs that I want to collect recipe data from. I am going to use a scan to an ORC (Optical Character Recognition) system for the cookbooks and make a web spider for the blogs. 

### Cleaning The Data

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

### Feature Engineering

### Modelling

### Communication
